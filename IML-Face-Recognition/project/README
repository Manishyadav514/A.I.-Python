		FACE RECOGNITION
======================================================================
A real time face recognition machine learning project that recognise people from webcam.
The whole procedure was divide into two parts:
1) Face Identification:
        We used Haarcascade classifier to perform face identification job. It basically captures frame from video and detects the face in it.
2) Face Recognition:
        We used LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm which recognize the input image and predict the person face in real time.
======================================================================
        CREATE DATASET
======================================================================
To generate the dataset for a new user whose face we want our model to recognize.
The user needs to click on the camera pop box and
press c to capture his/her image. To quit the pop window, when there are
enough images for detection, need to press “q”
